# OpenGLDemos
The beginnings of a scene-based set of OpenGL Demos that take advantage of some of the abstraction started in [OpenGL Experiments](https://github.com/ehorlocker/OpenGLExperiments). This program will be the basis of future learning on OpenGL and will be modified as the program evolves to handle more advanced topics.
